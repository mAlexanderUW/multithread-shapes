# multithread-shapes-master

A multithread project displaying the use of multithreading, semaphores and dynamic casting
using a simple object type of shapes.

Using a random number generator we make shapes of varying size, then alter those shapes
adding a third dimension to them. Display the results of those objects and tally the total
of the created objects.
